## DotaHQ
DotaHQ is a tracking app in the vein of Dotabuff and OpenDota for my guild MyyrYork, more affectionately known as Molehill Mobsters.

The purpose of this app is to display match and player data queried from OpenDota API in a 'curated' format.

## Roadmap/Todo
1. Client side app, curated feed for the whole guild and each player
more will come...
